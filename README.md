Ques : 
Given Input Vector (IV)  = {x: 10, y:2, z: 10} 
If true, go left else go right
What is the output class (blue circle)?
Implement a function that accepts input variable IV and return the class
Implement the function keeping in mind that the tree definition would be user defined and may change at runtime.
You will have to define the Tree data structure which can be taken as a user input or a declared variable.
